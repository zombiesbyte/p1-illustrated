# Joy

There are many different variations of digital joystick control. From something as simple as a 2-way horizontal
right up to an 5 (half 8) way direction.

The following is a list of the P1-illustrated naming system:
###### Key

# Buttons

![P1-illustrated](../master/images/assets/button_red.png)

We list the following co-ordinates for the button layouts

## General Document Notes / Rules
* all measurements are in pixels
* all measurements are shown as width x height (x and y)

## General Button Asset Notes / Rules
* Each button is 95 x 91
* Each button can have a potential label measuring 95 x 18
* Each label is positioned central under or above its button with a 15 margin between
* Between 1 - 8 buttons was chosen as these illustrate the majority of CP layouts

## Complete list of available configurations
Format: [a]-[b]
[a]: The number of buttons in this layout
[b]: The variation or design number
For example: 3-2; is the 2nd layout pattern with 3 buttons

* 1-1,
* 2-1, 2-2, 2-3,
* 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7,
* 4-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, 4-5, 4-6, 4-7,
* 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, 5-5, 5-6,
* 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4,
* 7-1,
* 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4,

**Total designs: 33**

## Button Layout Co-Ordinates
The following co-ordinates are relative. All buttons use the top-left corner for placement
This means that if a single button has been placed at the most top-left position then the 
co-ordinates will be 0,0. This however is group may be moved around on the final image by
inceasing the x,y as a cumulative collection.
